Time Series Forecasting with LSTM

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network using TensorFlow/Keras for time series prediction.

For demonstration, the dataset is a simple sine wave, and the goal is to predict the next value in the sequence given the previous 50 steps.

📌 Project Overview

Dataset: Synthetic sine wave (sin(x)).

Model: LSTM with dropout for regularization.

Goal: Predict future values of a time series based on past observations.

⚙️ Requirements

Install dependencies with:

pip install tensorflow numpy

🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or copy the script.


2. Run the Python file:

python lstm_timeseries.py


3. The model will:

Generate a sine wave dataset.

Train an LSTM on sliding windows of length 50.

Predict the next values in the sequence.

Print an example prediction.

🧠 Model Architecture

LSTM Layer with 50 units and ReLU activation.

Dropout Layer (0.2) to reduce overfitting.

Dense Layer with 1 neuron (final output).



---

📊 Training & Evaluation

Sequence length: 50 timesteps

Batch size: 32

Epochs: 10

Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Optimizer: Adam

📈 Example Output

After training, the model predicts the next step in the sine wave:

Predicted next value: [[-0.51892793]]

🔮 Future Improvements

Replace sine wave with real-world time series data (e.g., stock prices, weather data).

Add multiple LSTM layers for deeper learning.

Use Bidirectional LSTM or GRU for better performance.

Tune hyperparameters (sequence length, batch size, learning rate, etc.).
